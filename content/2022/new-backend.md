# New Backend, Same Website

Today I decided to switch my website from using [blogit](https://pedantic.software/git/blogit) to using [hugo](https://gohugo.io). Blogit requires way too much hacking at the crudely made Makefile, and hugo just werksâ„¢. I've also changed the favicon to ico format and modified it a little bit.

There will be more features coming to this blog at some point. There will be tagging, a proper archive page featuring all my blog posts sorted by year, and more.
