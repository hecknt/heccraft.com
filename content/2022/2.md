# 2
Today is a very special day, a once in a lifetime type deal. Today is Tuesday 2/22/22. Not only is that a really funny pun, but this day only happens every 400 years. This means that the next time that we're gonna have a Twosday is in 2422, and the last time we had a Twosday was in 1622.

## Unix Time
In case you missed Twosday and are reading this blog late, there is another date to look forward to, which is Unix time 2222222222. This will be at 06/02/40 03:57:02 UTC. You can kinda relive Twosday, although it will only be for a second, and you'll probably miss it entirely. If you don't want to miss 2222222222, then you need to have a reminder set on your calendar and be checking the clock at that exact moment.

## Math
If you do 2+2 or 2x2 or 2^2, you will get 4. We will have a 4/4/44 in a little over 22 years. This isn't anywhere near as exciting as Twosday, but it's about as close as you'll get within your lifetime (other than today of course.)

### Binary!!!
Your computer uses a base-2 number system. There are exactly 2 numbers used in base-2: 0 and 1. We won't be having a 1/1/1 or 11/11/11 in a long time, and a 0/0/0 does not exist, but binary is still a base-2 number system. You cannot take this away from me.

## The Periodic Table
Helium is a chemical in the Periodic table. It's atomic number is 2. Unfortunately I do not have any helium anywhere nearby, but it's still cool.
