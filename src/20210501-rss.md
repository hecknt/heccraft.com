# RSS Feed, and arch-install
There is now an RSS feed for my blogs.  
If you want to get my blog on your RSS reader, you can simply put [https://heccraft.com/rss.xml](https://heccraft.com/rss.xml) into your RSS reader and all of my blog posts will be put onto there.

I'm also creating a shell script for installing arch and artix linux. It's not complete yet, however when it is complete, you'll see it on my github page. All it does is install a bunch of packages. It wont clone any dotfiles, but I am considering uploading my dotfiles over to github with an installation script for them.
