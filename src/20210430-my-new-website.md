# My new website
This is just a test blog to make sure that everything is up and running.  
On this vps, I have done multiple things:

- Set up a website using [ssg5](https://github.com/fmash16/ssg5)</li>
- Set up an email server using [Luke Smith's emailwiz](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/emailwiz)</li>

This means that I now have a public email. My public email is [hec@heccraft.com](mailto:hec@heccraft.com). **Do not** try to fill my email with spam.  
I'm thinking that in the future I may open up a patreon or something similar, although right now I don't really have anything going for me, so this isnt happening at the moment.
