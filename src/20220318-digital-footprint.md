# How your name can get you screwed over
Recently, I had an experience where someone looked at my minecraft account to find this blog and eventually send me an email to confirm if I was the person they were looking for, and that gave me the idea to write this blog.

A person who I'm going to refer to as Joseph emailed me the other day, stating that they wanted to hunt me down a few years back and finally got around to doing it recently. He looked at the name history of my minecraft account to find a discord account, which was a dead end since my dms are off. He then looked further to find my blog, which contained my email address.

This gave me the idea to write this blog, and it got me thinking. If any incriminating personal information was linked to the name, then this probably wouldnt've have been a happy ending. Fortunately, I don't link any incriminating information to my online name, and I also really doubt that this guy was trying to screw me over in any way.

## How you could stop this from happening to yourself
If you think that someone from your past could look through your online history and find some serious personal information about you, then the best thing that you can do is delete any of your old accounts so that the person doesn't have anything to go off of. Go through every account that you have linked to your online name and either delete it or rid it of any personal information. Go through every step possible to make sure that your name isn't linked to you personally. If you're 100% sure that your name isn't linked to you personally, then don't worry about it. Just keep going with your day as normal.

## Obligitory Outro
What happened to me isn't a big enough deal for me to care. The fact that my minecraft account is linked to my blog isn't a big deal, since my minecraft account isn't linked to me personally anyways. It's just as much an online account as my blog is. I just thought it would be cool to make a blog about this.
